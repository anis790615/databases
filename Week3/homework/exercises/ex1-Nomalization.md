1. The only 1NF rule that the table violates is the requirement of **single valued attributes**, where both _food_code_ and _food_description_ columns have multiple values. I would suggest creating a separate _Food_ table that have _food_code_ and _food_description_ as its columns. _food_code_ is a **primary key**.
2. The super keys in the main table are difficult to find for all the combinations, without a clear view of the functional dependencies. The candidate keys are [{*member_id*, *dinner_id*}, {*member_name*, *dinner_id*}, *member_id*], from which the primary key _member_id_ should be derived. It is not logical however from the table how a member can have another dinner, as all members are unique and not repeated - each have one _dinner_id_. In reality, it would be logical that a member can repeat a visit and thus, a primary key should be a composite key _member_id_ & _dinner_id_.
3. For 2NF a new table _Members_ should be created, as _member_name_ and _member_address_ depend only on _member_id_ and not on _dinner_id_. The main table would be renamed to _Dinners_, for example, with member*id as a foreign key, forming a primary key with \_dinner_id*. If repeated visits were present in the table it would be apparent that _venue_code_ is dependent on _dinner_id_ and not on _member_id_, and thus, it's also should be moved along with its description to a new table _Venues_, forming one-to-many relationship with visits. It should be noted also that the _Food_ table created with 1NF in the first step has a many-to-many relationship with _Dinners_ table.
4. I'm assuming no transitive relations remain in the tables, and thus, the tables are already normalized to 3NF.
